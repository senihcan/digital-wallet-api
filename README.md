- `APPROVED` ‚Äì Automatically or manually approved
- `PENDING` ‚Äì Awaiting employee approval (for large transactions)
- `DENIED` ‚Äì Denied by employee

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- JWT is used for authentication.
- Role-based authorization handled via `SecurityFilterChain`
- `/api/auth/**` is publicly accessible
- All other endpoints require authentication

---

## üîç Swagger Customization

- Descriptions, request/response samples, and role explanations are added for better API documentation.
- JWT Bearer support is integrated into Swagger for testing secure endpoints easily.

---

## ‚ùó Error Handling

- Global exception handler (`@RestControllerAdvice`) manages business logic exceptions (`WalletOperationException`) and returns HTTP 400 with message.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Lazy vs Eager Loading

All entity relationships are reviewed:
- **Lazy loading** is used where recursive data (e.g. `User ‚Üí Customer ‚Üí User`) would cause infinite loops or bloated responses.
- DTOs are used for requests to avoid such issues.
